Role Name
=========

This simple `defaults` Ansible Role, is copying some fonts that I like and use in iTerm2. There were some fonts installed via brew at some point of future, but support was dropped. I decided to add this

The role, is also applying some generic OS settings that I'm using from machine to machine via the `scripts/defaults.sh`. Not all of them work as expected and it is in my TODO's to fix those when I find some time, but for now the important ones are working as expected.

Finally, it updates keyboard shortcuts for Input Language and Spotlight (it swaps cmd+space to Language Input and ctrl+space to Spotlight search).

Scripts
------------

The `scripts/defaults.sh` script is a collection of useful snippets that Iâ€™ve compiled over the years, found in different github repos used by many different engineers. My major TODO here is to also automate iTerm2 configuration but for various reasons, I haven't given time to do so but I have some useful comments.
